### Abstract <br>

High phosphorus loading in the Great Lakes is a well-documented problem leading to dire human and animal health,
environmental, and financial consequences. While this investigation aimed to identify indicators that can direct funding
and resources to areas of concern, we found significant sampling gaps across the Great Lakes basin that prevented
comprehensive predictive modeling. Further, Mann-Kendall testing primarily indicated no statistically significant
monotonic increasing or decreasing trend for phosphorus levels across Great Lakes states. Lastly, correlation matrices
between phosphorus levels, agricultural, census, and population data show low positive correlation, signaling that
non-linear, compounded relationships may contribute to the rise of phosphorus in the Great Lakes waterways. When the
same exercise was repeated with phosphorus nutrient data sampled three years after the point-in-time agricultural,
census, and population data were measured, a stronger positive correlation between Environmental Protection Agency
funding and phosphorus levels emerged. This indicates that although funding is directed to areas with high pollution,
the dollars may not be efficiently or adequately tamping down the unsafe phosphorus levels in the water.

Big data in and around the Great Lakes illustrates the need for a multi-pronged strategy to measurably decrease
troubling amounts of phosphorus. A richer sampling program that produces reliable, consistent data across the Great
Lakes region is the foremost recommendation to better identify and predict areas with burgeoning eutrophication. As no
widespread statistically significant decreasing trend in phosphorus levels was found, we also recommend an effective
mitigation strategy produced by targeted funding.
